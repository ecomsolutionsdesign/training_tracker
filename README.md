This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## 🔄 Migration Steps

### Step 1: Backup Your Current Code
```bash
# Create a backup of your current implementation
cp -r ./training ./training-backup
```

### Step 2: Install New Files
Copy all the new files to their respective locations:
- `components/Layout.js`
- `app/page.js`
- `app/employees/page.js`
- `app/topics/page.js`
- `app/schedules/page.js`
- `app/attendance/page.js`
- `app/pending/page.js`
- `app/reports/page.js`
- `app/layout.js` (updated)

### Step 3: Remove Old Component (Optional)
The old `components/TrainingTracker.js` can be archived or deleted as it's no longer used.

### Step 4: Update Navigation
No additional navigation setup needed! The Layout component handles all routing automatically.

## 🎨 Features Maintained

All original features are preserved:
- ✅ Employee management (CRUD)
- ✅ Topics management (CRUD)
- ✅ Schedule management with multi-topic support
- ✅ Attendance tracking with ratings
- ✅ Pending trainings tracking (3-month window)
- ✅ Department filtering across all pages
- ✅ Search functionality
- ✅ All 5 report types with CSV export
- ✅ Universal department logic (Top Management, HSE, HR)
- ✅ Validation and error handling
- ✅ Attendance locking after marking
- ✅ Date-based restrictions (no past schedules, attendance only on/after date)

## 🌐 Routing

The application now uses Next.js App Router:
- `/` - Dashboard
- `/employees` - Employee Management
- `/topics` - Topics Management
- `/schedules` - Schedule Management
- `/attendance` - Attendance Tracking
- `/pending` - Pending Trainings
- `/reports` - All Reports

## 🔧 Technical Details

### State Management
- Each page manages its own state independently
- Data fetching happens on component mount
- No shared state between pages (data is refetched as needed)

### API Structure
- All existing API routes remain unchanged
- No new API routes needed (reports are client-side generated)

### Styling
- Uses existing Tailwind CSS classes
- Maintains the green color scheme
- Responsive design preserved

## 📝 Notes

1. **No Database Changes**: All existing database models and schemas remain unchanged
2. **API Compatibility**: All API endpoints work exactly as before
3. **Feature Parity**: Every feature from the single-page app is preserved
4. **Performance**: Page-based routing improves initial load time
5. **Maintainability**: Code is now more modular and easier to maintain

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Navigation Not Working
- Ensure `components/Layout.js` is properly imported in each page
- Check that `next/navigation` is installed

### Styles Not Applied
- Verify `globals.css` is imported in `app/layout.js`
- Ensure Tailwind is properly configured

### API Calls Failing
- No changes to API - if calls fail, check network tab
- Verify MongoDB connection in `.env.local`

## 📦 Dependencies

No new dependencies required! The restructure uses:
- Next.js (existing)
- React (existing)
- Tailwind CSS (existing)
- lucide-react (existing)

## ✨ Future Enhancements

With this modular structure, you can now easily:
- Add new pages/features independently
- Implement role-based access control per page
- Add page-specific loading states
- Implement progressive enhancement
- Add API route handlers for reports if needed

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env.local`** - It contains sensitive credentials
2. **Use strong passwords** - Enforce password policies for users
3. **Change default credentials** - Update admin password immediately
4. **Keep dependencies updated** - Regularly update npm packages
5. **Use HTTPS in production** - Always use secure connections
6. **Validate user input** - All forms should have proper validation
7. **Regular backups** - Backup MongoDB database regularly

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot connect to MongoDB
- Ensure MongoDB is running
- Check `MONGODB_URI` in `.env.local`
- Verify network/firewall settings

### NextAuth errors
- Ensure `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is set in `.env.local`
- Verify `NEXTAUTH_URL` matches your application URL
- Clear browser cookies and try again

### Permission denied errors
- Check user role in the database
- Verify API route protection middleware
- Ensure user account is active

### Session issues
- Clear browser localStorage and cookies
- Restart the development server
- Check if JWT token is valid

## Production Deployment

1. Set proper environment variables:
   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=your-production-mongodb-url
   NEXTAUTH_URL=https://yourdomain.com
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-strong-production-secret
   ```

2. Build the application:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Start the production server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
